This is a collection of little snippets of code or small projects that don't quite deserve their own repo.

Most of these are toys or proofs of concept, don't judge my code too harshly!

retro68-opentransport-tcp-demo
------------------------------
This is a demo that sends a simple HTTP request over TCP.  What's the big deal?  It uses the Retro68 toolchain to target m68k and PPC Macs running System 7, 8, and 9, using the Open Transport networking framework.  I've tested it on a 9.2 PPC system, but it should run on the other combinations as well.  It is adapted from the Apple sample code "OTSimpleDownloadHTTP.c", as shown in "Open Transport Networking" from the "Inside Macintosh" book series.

I'm publishing this since there's a real dearth of modern code for vintage macs, and hopefully it can give anyone else an easier starting point than I had.

moskva-knob
-----------
An OpenSCAD 3D printable replacement film advance knob for the Moskva 5 camera.  The original film advance is very low profile and has vicious knurling, and the mechanism requires a bizarre amount of force.  This design is much easier to grip and rotate.

industar-lens-cap
-----------------
OpenSCAD front lens cap for the Industar 69 half frame lens.

1key-pcbs
---------
KiCAD experiments in the design of ultra-minimal single-key PCBs for mechanical keyboards (see upcoming blog post for details), with a goal of minimizing construction labor and cost.

cherry-mx-lockout
-----------------
OpenSCAD 3D printable clip that sits on the top of Cherry MX switches, under a 1U keycap, to block key presses.
