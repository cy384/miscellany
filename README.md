This is a collection of little snippets of code or small projects that don't quite deserve their own repo.

Most of these are toys or proofs of concept, don't judge my code too harshly!

moskva-knob
-----------
An OpenSCAD 3D printable replacement film advance knob for the Moskva 5 camera.  The original film advance is very low profile and has vicious knurling, and the mechanism requires a bizarre amount of force.  This design is much easier to grip and rotate.

industar-lens-cap
-----------------
OpenSCAD front lens cap for the Industar 69 half frame lens.

1key-pcbs
---------
KiCAD experiments in the design of ultra-minimal single-key PCBs for mechanical keyboards (see upcoming blog post for details), with a goal of minimizing construction labor and cost.

cherry-mx-lockout
-----------------
OpenSCAD 3D printable clip that sits on the top of Cherry MX switches, under a 1U keycap, to block key presses.
