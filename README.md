==========

This is a collection of little snippets of code or small projects that don't quite deserve their own repo.

Most of these are toys or proofs of concept, don't judge my code too harshly!

retro68-demos
-------------
These are some demos for doing networking on vintage Macs using the Retro68 toolchain.  Currently it's got demos for Open Transport (TCP and UDP) and MacTCP (UDP).  They've been tested on Mac OS 9.2, but should work on any version with Open Transport or MacTCP, respectively (note that Open Transport also emulates the MacTCP driver interface, for compatibility).

I'm publishing this since there's a real dearth of modern code for vintage macs, and hopefully it can give anyone interested an easy starting point.

moskva-knob
-----------
An OpenSCAD 3D printable replacement film advance knob for the Moskva 5 camera.  The original film advance is very low profile and has vicious knurling, and the mechanism requires a bizarre amount of force.  This design is much easier to grip and rotate.

industar-lens-cap
-----------------
OpenSCAD front lens cap for the Industar 69 half frame lens.

1key-pcbs
---------
KiCAD experiments in the design of ultra-minimal single-key PCBs for mechanical keyboards (see upcoming blog post for details), with a goal of minimizing construction labor and cost.

cherry-mx-lockout
-----------------
OpenSCAD 3D printable clip that sits on the top of Cherry MX switches, under a 1U keycap, to block key presses.
