sx6012-fans
===============================================
FreeCAD 3D printable top for Mellanox SX 6012 / 1012 / 6005 switches, allowing the use of 120mm fans instead of the extremely loud 40mm fans.

Parts needed:

* one 3D print of each file here
* fan controller (I'm using a "MEIRIYFA 3 Pin 4 Pin Fan Adapter PWM PC Chassis Cooling Fan Hub 8 Way Splitter 12V Speed Controller with 6 Pin Power Port" from Amazon)
* two 120mm fans

You'll need to power the fan controller.  I recommend cutting the cables off the stock fans and soldering those to the controller.  If you solder directly to the 12V output of one of the power supplies, note that the fans will only be on if that PSU is plugged in.  If you're bold you can wire the fan tachometer output, too.

Pinout for the stock fans in my sx6012:

* red: 12V
* blue: TACH
* yellow: PWM
* black: GND

Caveat emptor!  The power supplies are not covered inside of these, you are responsible for your safety!  Consider printing these in a high temperature plastic!
